## Expansion Settings:

Source: https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-AIPatrolSettings

[Return to the summary](https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-Server-settings/)

### `m_Version`

Integer.

Contains the current setting version number, **never** change this value unless you *really* know what you are doing as it's used internally for automatic conversion of old settings whenever we change something.

### `Enabled`

Boolean.

* 0 = OFF | Disabled
* 1 = ON | Enabled

### `FormationScale`

Float. How far apart the individual formation positions are.

For formations that are on a grid (like Vee, InvVee, Wall, Column and InvColumn), the value determines the side length of the grid in meters.

For formations that are not on a grid (like Star, StarDot, Circle and CircleDot), the value roughly determines the distance between the positions (in case of star-based formations, the inner positions, with distances between outer positions scaled accordingly).

Default: -1.0 (uses AISettings.json value, which defaults to 1.0)

### `DespawnTime`

Float. How long in seconds will it take for the patrol to despawn if no players are in DespawnRadius.

* -1 = Use the value from AISettings.json

### `RespawnTime`

Float. How long in seconds until this patrol can respawn if no players are in MinDistRadius ?

* If set to -1 will use the value from AISettings.json

### `MinDistRadius`

Float. The required minimum distance from a player to spawn. If a player is closer than MinDistRadius meters, then the patrol won't spawn

* If set to -1 will use the value from AISettings.json

### `MaxDistRadius`

Float. The required maxium distance from a player to spawn. If a player is further away than MaxDistRadius meters, then the patrol won't spawn

* If set to -1 will use the value from AISettings.json

### `DespawnRadius`

Float. The required distance from a player to despawn. If a player is closer than DespawnRadius meters, then the patrol won't despawn

### `AccuracyMin`

Float. Minimum accuracy of the AI (0.0-1.0)

* If set to -1 will use the value from AISettings.json

### `AccuracyMax`

Float. Maximum accuracy of the AI (0.0-1.0)

* If set to -1 will use the value from AISettings.json

### `ThreatDistanceLimit`

Float. Distance in meters when the target will start be considered a potential threat. AI will not see enemies past this distance, so use with care.

* If set to -1 will use the value from AISettings.json

### `NoiseInvestigationDistanceLimit`

Float. Max distance in meters that AI will search for noise sources. -1 = use value from AISettings.json

### `MaxFlankingDistance`

Float. Max distance to enemy in meters that AI will try to flank the enemy (default 200). -1 = use value from AISettings.json

### `EnableFlankingOutsideCombat`

Int. Enable flanking outside combat. Note that this will give AI a sort of "sixth sense" about enemies, but not necessarily their exact position when there is no line of sight. 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled, -1 = use value from AISettings.json

### `DamageMultiplier`

Float. Damage multiplier from the AI (default 1.0 = no change). Base damage they will deal multiplied by this value.

* If set to -1 will use the value from AISettings.json

### `DamageReceivedMultiplier`

Damage multiplier for damage the AI receive (default 1.0 = no change). Base damage they receive will be multiplied by this value.

* If set to -1 will use the value from AISettings.json

## Expansion Settings:

Source: https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-AI-Load-Balancing

`mpmissions/dayzoffline.mapname/expansion/settings/AIPatrolSettings.json` contains the load balancing settings.

### `LoadBalancingCategories`

Allows to specify how many patrols of each type are allowed to spawn/stay depending on the amount of online players. If a patrol is already spawned, and more players connect than the load balancing allows for that range of players, then the patrol will automatically despawn (AI will sit down just like players would when logging out, and cannot be killed while in this despawn phase).

Each individual patrol can have a `LoadBalancingCategory` assigned, and each category can define at least one or more entries that define ranges of online players and maximum amount of patrols for each range.

If no category is assigned (`""`), then the following defaults will be used:

* `ObjectPatrols` will use the `ObjectPatrol` category (if it exists)
* `Patrols` will use the `Patrol` category (if it exists)
* Quest AI (e.g. AICamp or AIPatrol when DayZ-Expansion-Quests is loaded) will use the `Quest` category (if it exists)

If a `Global` category exists, it will always be used in addition to the individual categories, so if an individual category doesn't limit a patrol, then any global limit(s) will still be in effect (if any).

Note that a value of `-1` for `MaxPatrols` means no limit will be applied by that specific entry.

You can edit, add and remove categories to your liking, there's no requirement to stick to any default category (but note that if you want global patrol limiting, then the category needs to be called `Global`). Removing all categories means no limits will be in effect.

Example of a default configuration:

```
    "LoadBalancingCategories": {
        "Example": [
            {
                "MinPlayers": 0,
                "MaxPlayers": 255,
                "MaxPatrols": -1
            }
        ],
        "Quest": [
            {
                "MinPlayers": 0,
                "MaxPlayers": 255,
                "MaxPatrols": -1
            }
        ],
        "ObjectPatrol": [
            {
                "MinPlayers": 0,
                "MaxPlayers": 255,
                "MaxPatrols": 5
            }
        ],
        "HelicopterWreck": [
            {
                "MinPlayers": 0,
                "MaxPlayers": 255,
                "MaxPatrols": 3
            }
        ],
        "Global": [
            {
                "MinPlayers": 0,
                "MaxPlayers": 10,
                "MaxPatrols": 10
            },
            {
                "MinPlayers": 11,
                "MaxPlayers": 20,
                "MaxPatrols": 8
            },
            {
                "MinPlayers": 21,
                "MaxPlayers": 30,
                "MaxPatrols": 6
            },
            {
                "MinPlayers": 31,
                "MaxPlayers": 40,
                "MaxPatrols": 4
            },
            {
                "MinPlayers": 41,
                "MaxPlayers": 50,
                "MaxPatrols": 2
            },
            {
                "MinPlayers": 51,
                "MaxPlayers": 255,
                "MaxPatrols": 0
            }
        ],
        "ContaminatedArea": [
            {
                "MinPlayers": 0,
                "MaxPlayers": 255,
                "MaxPatrols": 2
            }
        ],
        "Patrol": [
            {
                "MinPlayers": 0,
                "MaxPlayers": 255,
                "MaxPatrols": 5
            }
        ]
    }
```

The default settings are fairly conservative, and allow up to 10 patrols (with anywhere from 1-3 AI each) when up to 10 players are online, but only 2 patrols when 50 players are online. This assumes a server that can handle 60 players.

## Example file

Source: https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-AI-Location-Settings

This file controls how AI navigate the world.

You can find this file at `mpmissions\<mapname>\expansion\settings\AILocationSettings.json`

### `RoamingLocations`

List of available locations for roaming AI (`"WaypointBehavior": "ROAMING"` in AIPatrolSettings.json). This will be filled automatically from the locations found in `CfgWorlds <mapname> Names`.
For maps that have no named locations, a list of random locations will be auto-generated 10 seconds after the server has finished loading.

Each location needs to have the following format:

```
        {
            "Name": "Settlement_Capital (Petropavlovsk-Sakhalinsky)",
            "Position": [
                4749.0,
                0.0,
                10695.0
            ],
            "Radius": 1000.0,
            "Type": "Capital",
            "Enabled": 1
        }
```

`Name` is just tell the locations apart more easily and you can choose anything you like. `Type` is pre-filled from the entries in `CfgWorlds`, you can leave it empty when adding custom locations.
If `Enabled` is 1 or `true`, AI can pick it as roaming destination, if it is 0 or `false`, the location will be ignored.

### `ExcludedRoamingBuildings`

List of building classnames or partial classnames (compared from the beginning of each string) that roaming AI (`"WaypointBehavior": "ROAMING"` in AIPatrolSettings.json) should not pick as destination (they may still go there to loot, which is fine).
It is **strongly** recommended to leave the defaults intact and only add to this list.

### `NoGoAreas`

List of areas that AI should avoid. Use sparsely since it affects pathfinding efficiency.
Each no go area needs to be in the following format:

```
	{
            "Name": "Hashima Exclusion Zone",
            "Position": [
                558.0,
                0.0,
                4558.0
            ],
            "Radius": 300.0,
            "Height": 130.0
        }
```

# Example file

Just an example, do NOT use this on your server.

---

### `"m_Version"`

Integer.

Contains the current setting version number, **never** change this value unless you *really* know what you are doing as it's used internally for automatic conversion of old settings whenever we change something.

### `"ServerMarkerOnDropLocation"`

Bool.

* 0 = No marker will be created to show the exact location of the airdrop drop point.
* 1 = The server will create a marker on the map on the airdrop drop location (where the crate will land).

* 1 = The marker will be also in 3D.

### `"ShowAirdropTypeOnMarker"`

Bool. If "ServerMarkerOnDropLocation" is set to 0 you can ignore this setting.

* 1 = The marker name will specify what type of airdrop it is (Military, Medical, Basebuilding for example).

### `"HeightIsRelativeToGroundLevel"`

Bool.

* 0 = The plane will not try to adapt his altitude based on the elevation of the ground.
* 1 = The plane will try to adapt his altitude based on the elevation of the ground.

### `"Height"`

* Chance: The chance of spawning (1.00 = 100% and 0.00 = 0%)
* QuantityPercent:
  + 0 to 100 will be the quantity of this item in percent. ( My desired quantity / Max quantity of the item ) \* 100 = My Percentage
  + -1 will be it's default value (100%).
  + -2 will use the quantmin and quandmax from your types.xml and any values between 0 and 100 will be the quantity in percentage.
* Max: The maximum amount of time this item is allowed to be spawned in the container. -1 will skip this condition
* Variants: Variants of the items. It could be different colors of the same item, or different attachments for the same gun.

[Return to the overview "The Market System"](https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-The-Market-System)

---

### `"m_Version"`

Integer.

Contains the current setting version number, **never** change this value unless you *really* know what you are doing as it's used internally for automatic conversion of old settings whenever we change something.

### `"DisplayName"`

String.

Display name of the market category that will be used within the market menu.

You can use **Localized** strings `#STR_BLABLA` or raw text `Hello World !`. Here are two examples:

```
"DisplayName": "#STR_EXPANSION_MARKET_CATEGORY_AMMOBOXES",
```

```
"DisplayName": "Ammo Boxes",
```

### `"Icon"`

String.

Icon of the category that will be displayed. You can find a list of valid icon names at <https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-List-of-default-icon-names>

```
"Icon": "Deliver",
```

### `"Color"`

String.

The **Hex color code** for this category.

You can find many online tools and softwares to find the desired color like this website for example <https://www.color-hex.com/> (without the # )

```
"Color": "FBFCFEFF",
```

### `"IsExchange"`

Bool.

Is this category (this file) used for any type of currencies players will use to buy and sell items.

```
"IsExchange": 0,
```

### `"InitStockPercent"`

Float.

`Percentage of max stock` that each item will be initialized to in each zone on first server start (will only take effect for new zone files or zone files that did not have the item yet, or if you remove the item's existing entry from the existing zone file).

```
"InitStockPercent": 75.0,
```

### `"Items"`

Array of items.

Contains all the items and associated information for price and stock control.

* **`"ClassName"`:** String. Class name of the item/object you want to add to this category.
* **`"MaxPriceThreshold"`:** Integer. Maximum price the item can have (when stock is at minimum).
* **`"MinPriceThreshold"`:** Integer. Minimal price the item can have (when stock is at maximum).
* **`"SellPricePercent"`:** Float. Percentage of the price to use as sell price. Special value `-1` means use zone setting. Note that unlike for zones, the encoding used here is bfloat16 to optimize network performance, so precision is limited to around two to three decimal digits.
* **`"MaxStockThreshold"`:** Integer. Maximum stock the item can have overall in the market.
* **`"MinStockThreshold"`:** Integer. Minimal stock the item can have in the market.
* **`"QuantityPercent"`:** Integer. From 0 to 100 will be the percentage of the quantity of the item (mag, liquid, ammo, etc). -1 will default to 100%
* **`"SpawnAttachments"`:** Array [String]. Contains all the class names of items that will be attached by default when the player decides to buy the item with its default attachments. This also works with weapons if you want to create default weapon loadouts.
* **`"Variants"`:** Array [String]. Contains all the class names of the items that will be displayed as a variant for this base item.
  If you have for example different color variations for an item, then you can add these items into this array and they will be displayed in a dropdown menu in the detailed market item section whenever the base item has been selected. By default a variant will take over the configuration of the base item. If you want to have a different min/max price or min/max stock threshold configuration for a variant, then it also needs its own entry in the "Items" array with the desired configuration.

If you want an item to have static (infinite) stock, set both `MinStockThreshold` and `MaxStockThreshold` to 1.

If you want an item to have static price, set both `MinPriceThreshold` and `MaxPriceThreshold` to the same value.

a few examples:

```

    "ClassName": "ammobox_00buck_10rnd",
    "MaxPriceThreshold": 80,

[Return to the overview "The Market System"](https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-The-Market-System)

Unlike most other settings that may not be map-specific, you can find the traderzones folder in your mpmission\dayzOffline.`<mapname>`\expansion folder.

Traders will only act as traders if they are within the radius of a traderzone. NOTE that zones are spheres, so altitude for `Position` needs to be set correctly!

### `"SellPricePercent"`

Float.

This controls the sell price for all market items in this specific zone.
By default this value is -1.0, meaning the global value from market settings will be used, but can be overridden by setting this to the desired percentage.

### `"Stock"`

Map<String, Integer>.

Contains all the items that can be purchased in this market zone and the current stock of each item.
You can set the stock for each individual item or set it to 0 (meaning traders in this zone will only start selling the item after players have sold at least one of the respective item to the trader).

[Return to the summary](https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-Server-settings/)

---

### `"m_Version"`

Integer.

Contains the current setting version number, **never** change this value unless you *really* know what you are doing as it's used internally for automatic conversion of old settings whenever we change something.

### `"ExplosionTime"`

Integer. Time in seconds it takes for the ExpansionSatchel to explode.

### `"ExplosiveDamageWhitelist"`

Array of string. Put every classname of the explosive items you want to be able to be used for raiding.

The classnames are not the **weapons items** nor the **explosives items** but the explosion itself. For example you can disable rpg explosions with "Expansion\_RPG\_Explosion"

```
"ExplosiveDamageWhitelist": [
    "classname01_withaCommaAtTheEnd",
    "classname02_withoutCommaAtTheEndBecauseItsTheLastOne"
],
```

### `"EnableExplosiveWhitelist"`

Bool.

* 0 = Every items from the game will be able to raid basebuilding elements regardless of ExplosiveDamageWhitelist.
* 1 = Only the items listed above will be able to raid basebuilding elements.

### `"ExplosionDamageMultiplier"`

Float. It is a damage multiplier for all explosion type damages to Expansion base parts. For example with the default value of 50, a grenade that does 50 damage will do 50 \* 50 damage to the wall, so 2500. For reference, vanilla grenades do 50 damage, Expansion rockets do 300, and C4 does 600. Less than 1 values work here as well, so 0x will disable damage to base parts, and .5x will halve them. Note, walls currently have an HP of 30,000.

### `"ProjectileDamageMultiplier"`

Float. It is a damage multiplier for all bullet type damages to Expansion base parts. For example with the default value of 2, a bullet that does 65 damage will do 65 \* 2 damage to the wall, so 130. **Less than 1 values work here as well, so 0x will disable damage** to base parts, and .5x will halve them. Note, walls currently have an HP of 30,000.

### `"CanRaidSafes"`

Bool.

* 0 = Players won't be able to destroy Expansion safes.
* 1 = Allow to players to raid expansion safes.

### `"SafeExplosionDamageMultiplier"`

Float. It is a damage multiplier for all explosion type damages to Expansion base parts. For example with the default value of 50, a grenade that does 50 damage will do 50 \* 50 damage to the safe, so 2500. For reference, vanilla grenades do 50 damage, Expansion rockets do 300, and C4 does 600. Less than 1 values work here as well, so 0x will disable damage to base parts, and .5x will halve them. Note, safes currently have 20,000 15,000 and 10,000 HP.

### `"SafeProjectileDamageMultiplier"`

Float. It is a damage multiplier for all bullet type damages to Expansion base parts. For example with the default value of 2, a bullet that does 65 damage will do 65 \* 2 damage to the safe, so 130. **Less than 1 values work here as well, so 0x will disable damage** to base parts, and .5x will halve them. Note, safes currently have 20,000 15,000 and 10,000 HP.

### `"SafeRaidTools"`

Array. List of tools allowed for raiding safes

```
"SafeRaidTools": [
    "classname01_withaCommaAtTheEnd",
    "classname02_withoutCommaAtTheEndBecauseItsTheLastOne"
],
```

### `"SafeRaidToolTimeSeconds"`

Integer. Time needed to raid safe with tool

### `"SafeRaidToolCycles"`

Integer. Number of cycles needed to raid safe

### `"SafeRaidToolDamagePercent"`

Integer. Total damage dealt to tool over time (100 = tool will be in ruined state after all cycles finished)

### `"BarbedWireRaidTools"`

Array. List of tools allowed for raiding barbed wire

```
"BarbedWireRaidTools": [
    "classname01_withaCommaAtTheEnd",

],
```

### `"BarbedWireRaidToolTimeSeconds"`

Integer. Time needed to raid barbed wire with tool

### `"BarbedWireRaidToolCycles"`

Integer. Number of cycles needed to raid barbed wire

### `"BarbedWireRaidToolDamagePercent"`

Integer. Total damage dealt to tool over time (100 = tool will be in ruined state after all cycles finished)

### `"CanRaidLocksOnWalls"`

Integer.

* 0 = You can't raid codelocks on tents
* 1 = Make locks (both vanilla and Expansion) raidable on walls doors and gates
* 2 = Make locks (both vanilla and Expansion) raidable on wall doors
* 3 = Make locks (both vanilla and Expansion) raidable on wall gates

### `"CanRaidLocksOnFences"`

Bool.

* 0 = You can't raid codelocks on fences
* 1 = Make locks (both vanilla and Expansion) raidable on fences

### `"CanRaidLocksOnTents"`

Bool.

* 0 = You can't raid codelocks on tents
